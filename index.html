		<p>About Gdevelop
		Gdevelop is an event based software meaning it works on the basis of an action being performed when a certain condition is fulfilled. To make it easier for developers, the platform uses a visual coding language meaning the developers don't have to type a single line of code, however we are provided with an option to add our own text based code if we would like to go more in-depth. Gdeveop works on all platforms- Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS and even web browser. Gdevelop is an open source software thus allowing it's users to add their own features or additions to the platform in any way they want.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Here's a more detailed look:
		No-Code Development:
		GDevelop uses an event-based system where you can create game logic by combining conditions and actions visually, rather than writing traditional code. 
		Cross-Platform:
		GDevelop can be used to build games for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and web browsers. 
		Open Source:
		GDevelop is free and open-source, meaning its code is publicly available and can be modified or extended. 
		Visual Interface:
		It features a drag-and-drop interface with ready-made behaviors and extensions, making it easy to get started. 
		Asset Store:
		GDevelop includes a built-in Asset Store with various game assets to help streamline the development 	process. 
		Educational Use:
		GDevelop is also used in educational settings for teaching game development. 
		Community and Support:
		GDevelop has a large and active community, with tutorials, documentation, and a Discord server for support.</p>
		<p id="game"> The marvels of Gdevelop can create many games that tickle the fancy of any crowd of people like a particular game we made called Driving Simulator:-</p>
		<br>
		<h2>F1 Simulator</h2>
		<br>
		<p>This game made by our team is based on racing and you will be racing as an F1 car racing through different high speed circuits. You can select your own car which has different speed. It has great graphics and sound effects which adds some realism in the game.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As it is made in Gdevelop it also uses IFTT logic like - if a certain key is pressed, the car will move forward or backward etc.</p>
